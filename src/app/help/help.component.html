      Default choice is "Draw" which is not possible in IPL, hence it will result in loss of points.
      i.e. "Draw" is looser regardless of match result. In IPL, if match ends up in a tie then super over decides the winner.

    <li>
      For each <b>incorrect</b> prediction <b>10 points</b> will be deducted for league matches, <b>25 points</b> for Semi Finals/Eliminators, <b>50 points</b> for Final
    </li>
    <li>
      For each correct prediction points will be given based on number of loosers.
      Formula to calculate points for winners is <b>(# of loosers * matchPoint)/(# of winners)</b>.
      Here, matchPoint = 10 for League match, 25 for Semi Finals/Eliminators, 50 for Final
    </li>
    <li>
      Example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lets assume there are 10 people playing
        </li>
        <li>
          Match is MI vs RCB on April-09-2021 at 7:30 PM IST
        </li>
        <li>
          3 people are predicting on MI, 5 on RCB and 2 on "Draw" (2 people didnt select any option)
        </li>
        <li>
          Match is locked on April-09-2021 at 6:30 PM IST. After this you cannot change your prediction for this match
        </li>
        <li>
          Formula to calculate points for winners is (# of loosers * 10 points)/(# of winners).
          Loosers will get -10 for league match, -25 for semi finals and eliminators, -50 for final
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, if MI wins, then 3 people predicting on MI will get (7*10/3) points. i.e.
          Here, loosers are people predicting on RCB and "Draw" who will get -10 points each (for league match)
        </li>
        <li>
          If RCB wins, then 5 people predicting on RCB will get (5*10/5) points. i.e. (# of loosers * 10 points)/(# of winners).
          Here, loosers are people predicting on MI and "Draw" who will get -10 points each (for league match)
